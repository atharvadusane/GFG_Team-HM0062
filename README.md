-Deploying this website was getting a bit of a task for me thus I wasn't able to upload the live website link. But I'm looking into it until the offline round.

-Due to time constraints, the navbar and footer were not made up to the mark.
-The overall website has a pretty good ideology ie. to make individuals literate about finance fundamentals and give them a rough idea about their current financial planning.
-The main focus was on user authentication and validation.
-Users can register and enter their financial status via which we'd be able to calculate their future financial planning.
-Currently, the website calculates and recommends users segregate their investments as seen in the expense tab.
-The user also knows the time required to reach his desired amount for the respective goal.
